\title{Computes the  Distance Covariance Entropy (DICE)}
\usage{
CompDICE(data.m, useSpear = FALSE, std = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.m}{The input data matrix, representing the normalized gene expression data matrix
over regulatory factors (rows) and single cells (columns).}

\item{useSpear}{A logical to specify whether to use Spearman correlations when computing the correlation between the distance vectors. By default this is FALSE}

\item{std}{A logical to specify whether the distance vectors should be standardized to unit variance.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements

dice
The DICE value with constant term removed

diceN
The DICE value with constant term (i.e. taking the dimensionality of the dataset into account)

evals
The eigenvalues of the distance covariance matrix
}
\description{
This is the main user function for computing the Distance Covariance
Entropy (DICE). It takes as input the normalized gene expression data matrix
defined over the regulatory factors of interest (rows) and single cells (columns).
