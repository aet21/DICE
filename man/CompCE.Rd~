\title{Computes the  Ordinary Covariance Entropy (CE)}
\usage{
CompCE(data.m, useSpear = FALSE, std = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.m}{The input data matrix, representing the normalized gene expression data matrix
over regulatory factors (rows) and single cells (columns).}

\item{useSpear}{A logical to specify whether to use Spearman correlations when computing the correlations between regulatory factors/genes. By default this is FALSE}

\item{std}{A logical to specify whether the expression profiles should be standardized to unit variance.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements

ce
The CE value with constant term removed

ceN
The CE value with constant term (i.e. taking the dimensionality of the dataset into account)

evals
The eigenvalues of the covariance matrix

#'
}
\description{
This is the main user function for computing the Covariance
Entropy (CE). It takes as input the normalized gene expression data matrix
defined over the regulatory factors of interest (rows) and single cells (columns).
