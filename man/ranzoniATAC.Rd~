\description{
The data here consists of three objects.

\code{primedCellMarker.l} is a list of two vectors, containing the marker genes for primedMEMPs and primedGPs. The marker genes were defined by doing Wilcoxon rank sum tests on expression data between the corresponding primed cells and other multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and selecting genes with significantly higher expression in the corresponding primed cells.

\code{ranzoni.gene.access.m} is a matrix of normalized gene level accessibility data over 947 genes across 2264 MPPs. The gene level accessibility data were derived from scATAC-Seq peak data from Ranzoni et al., generated by aggregating accessible counts within the range of 3kb upstream a gene and the gene body for each gene, and log-normalized using \code{\link[Seurat]{NormalizeData}}. For this matrix, the 947 genes are the genes that exist in the gene level accessibility data from the original peak data and are also the marker genes for primed cells abovementioned.

\code{ranzoni.TFA.m} is a subset of matrix of TF activity calculated with chromVAR algorithm by applying \code{\link[Signac]{RunChromVAR}} on scATAC-Seq data from Ranzoni et al. Here the matrix contains TF activity for GATA1, KLF1 and IRF8 for they are identified as the driving factors for priming towards megakaryote-erythrocyte-mast progenitors (MEMPs) and granulocyte progenitors (GPs).
